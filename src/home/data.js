Everest expedition and Mt. Lhotse expedition in spring 2021. Likewise Mera peak, Labuche peak, and Island peak expeditions were all completed successfully in 2021 but, due to the unfortunate occurrence of the second wave of the pandemic during the spring season of 2021, Mt. Everest and Mt. Lhotse expeditions had to be stopped even though all the climbing members had completed the acclimatization process.",
  descriptionSecond:
    "After the second wave subsided, we have organized the Manaslu expedition, Dhaulagiri vii expedition, and Amadablam expedition successfully, in autumn 2021. Mera peak expedition was successfully organized and accomplished in the end of autumn 2021.All expeditions, treks, and tours including the international Everest expedition will continue operating in spring 2022.We want to assure all our trekking & expedition clients, that Iceland Trekking and Expedition is prepared to start all regular activities in upcoming 2022.
